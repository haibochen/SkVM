/**
 * Contract for a registered custom evaluator.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - `run` returns everything EXCEPT `criterion`. The framework
 *   (`evaluateCustom` in `framework/evaluator.ts`) owns criterion attachment
 *   so that `id`, `name`, and `weight` declared on the task-level criterion
 *   always flow through. A custom evaluator that tries to fabricate its own
 *   criterion gets a compile error.
 * - `loadPayload` and `savePayload` are OPTIONAL sibling-file conventions.
 *   For evaluators whose payload fits comfortably inline in task.json (e.g.
 *   a small JSON config), both can be omitted and the payload round-trips
 *   through the JSON. For evaluators whose payload is large or better
 *   authored as a standalone file (e.g. `grade.py`), implement both and the
 *   loader/writer pair will move the payload in and out of the sidecar.
 * - `validatePayload` is OPTIONAL and runs at load time (inside
 *   `hydrateEvalPayloads`) after any sidecar hydration. Evaluators whose
 *   payload is structured (e.g. `junit-grade` with its declarative criteria
 *   list) should implement this to catch authoring errors before a task is
 *   ever run — failing fast saves LLM tokens on downstream bench runs. The
 *   hook MUST throw with a descriptive `Error` on invalid input; returning
 *   is treated as valid. Re-throwing `ZodError` is idiomatic.
 * - `checkIntegrity` is OPTIONAL and runs at load time after
 *   `hydrateEvalPayloads` for callers that opt in (currently only the
 *   jit-optimize synthetic task loader). It's for catching the class of
 *   authoring bug where the payload shape is valid but a required file on
 *   disk is missing — e.g. a `junit-grade` criterion whose `testFile` does
 *   not exist under `fixtures/`, or a `python-grade` criterion that was
 *   hydrated with no `grade.py` sibling. Returning `{ok:false, reason}`
 *   causes the caller to drop the task before it enters the evaluation
 *   batch instead of letting it run and score 0.
