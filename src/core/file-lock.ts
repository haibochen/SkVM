/**
 * Cross-process file lock with crash-safe cleanup.
 *
 * Design goals:
 *   1. Atomic acquire via O_CREAT|O_EXCL (no races between concurrent acquirers).
 *   2. Crash recovery without waiting the full TTL: each lock file records the
 *      holder's pid + hostname. If the holder is on this host and no longer
 *      running (kill(pid, 0) → ESRCH), the lock is considered free.
 *   3. Graceful Ctrl-C: SIGINT / SIGTERM / SIGHUP / beforeExit release every
 *      lock currently held by this process before the process exits.
 *   4. Cross-host fallback: if the holder is on a different machine (shared
 *      filesystem) we can't probe it, so we fall back to an mtime TTL.
 *
 * Three public call shapes:
 *   - tryAcquireFileLock(file, opts)  → one-shot, returns boolean
 *   - acquireFileLock(file, opts)     → blocks with backoff, throws on timeout
 *   - withFileLock(file, opts, fn)    → acquire, run, release (even on throw)
 *
 * A single module is shared by jit-optimize proposals and the openclaw adapter.
